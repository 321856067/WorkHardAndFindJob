#### 编程题
**1、Grid climbing**
A grid with m rows and n columns is used to form a cluster of nodes. If a point in the grid has a value of 1, then it represents a node.
Each node in the cluster has a level associated with it. A node located in the i th row of the grid is a level i node.
Here are the rules for creating a cluster:
* Every node at level i connects to all nodes at level k where k > i and k is the first level to have any nodes after level i.
* When i reaches the laste level in the grid, no more connections are possible.
Given such a grid, find the number of connections present in the cluster.

**Example:**
gridOfNode = [[1, 0, 1, 1],[0, 1, 1, 0],[0, 0, 0, 0],[1, 0, 0, 0]]
![图片](/Users/y1271752959m/Desktop/找工作/images/1.png)
The number of Connection in the above cluster=8

**Function Description**
Compete the **numberOfConnetions** function in the editor below. **The function must return an integer denoting the number of connetions**
**numberOfConnetions** has the following parameter(s):
    gridOnNode: A 2D integer array, the grid of nodes.

**Constrains**
* 1 <= n <= 500
* 1 <= m <= 500
* gridOnNode(ij) belongs to [0, 1]

```
class Result{
	/**
	* Complete the 'numerOfConnections' function below.
	*
	* The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
	* The function accepts 2D_INTEGER_ARRAY gridOfNodes as parameter.
	*/
	public static int numberOfConnetions(List<List<Integer>> gridOfNodes){
		//write your code here
	}
}
```

**2、Inversions**
A subsequence is created by deletion zere or more elements from a list while maintaing the order. For example, the subsequences of [1,2,3] are [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3].
An inversion is a strictly decreasing subsequence of length 3.
More formally, given an array, p = p[n] an inversion in the array is any time some p[i] > p[j] > p[k] and i < j < k.
Determine the number of inversions within a given array.

**Example**
n = 5
arr = [5, 3, 4, 2, 1].

The array inversions are:
```
[5, 3, 2]
[5, 3, 1]
[5, 4, 2]
[5, 4, 1]
[5, 2, 1]
[3, 2, 1]
[4, 2, 1]
```
**Example2**
n = 4
arr = [4, 2, 2, 1].

The only inversion is [4, 2, 1] and there are tow instances:
indices 0, 1, 3 and indices 0, 2, 3. The array [4, 2, 2] and [2, 2, 1] are not considered inversion because the are note strictly decreasing.

```
Class Result{
	/**
	* Complete the 'maxInversions' function below.
	*
	* The function is expected to return an LONG_INTEGER.
	* The function accepts INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.
	*/
	public static long maxInversions(List<Integer> arr){
		//write your code here
	}
}
```
